# QASR Paired Programming Workshop

This repository is for Paired Programming Workshop hosted by QASR (Quantitative Approaches to Social Research) student club.
This workshop is intended to support students to improve their programming and presentation skills.

If you have any questions, please email to [qasr@columbia.edu](mailto:qasr@columbia.edu)



## 1. Before the Workshop: Sign Up
---
QASR will send out email about signing up for the workshop. Sign up through the google form. You will have to specify your programming language (Python, R, or both). Those who signed up will get a zoom link.

Please remember to sign up.


## 2. At the Workshop: Pair Up, Code, and Share
---
#### **1) Join the zoom**

Join the zoom link and specify your programming language in your name. (i.e. R_JohnDoe, Python/R_JohnDoe). You can do this by i) Specifying the name upon entry, ii) right click your profile picture, and change the name. Please refer to the screenshots below.

![Zoom Name 1]('/images/zoom1')

![Zoom name 2]('/images/zoom2')


#### **2) Go to your breakout room**

Based on your programming language, you will be assigned to a breakout room. You will have a sidekick "breakout" room from the main zoom meeting room. Check this [link](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/206476313-Managing-Video-Breakout-Rooms) for breakout room information.

You will be able to share your screens and talk to your partner without interrupting others.


#### **3) Code together**

Start coding together! You can choose one of the three methods, or other methods to program together. We recommend **Google Colab** so that you have real paired programming experience.

* **Google Colab**
Go to [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/) and start a notebook. You will see this screen. Click **"New Notebook"**
![Google Colab Start Page]('/images/colab1.png')

On the top right corner, there is a **share** button. Click it to generate a shareable link. Make sure that you change the option to **edit** to generate the link. Share copy the link and share or send an email.
![Google Colab Share]('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bolimsydneyson/QASR_paired_programming/master/images/colab3_link.png')
![Google Colab Email Share]('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bolimsydneyson/QASR_paired_programming/master/images/colab3_email.png')

On the top left corner, you will be able to add code chunks or text chunks. This is basically Python Notebook format.

* **Google Docs**
Go to [https://docs.google.com/](https://docs.google.com/) and start a new document.

On the top right corner, there is a **share** button. Click it to generate a shareable link. Make sure that you change the option to **edit** to generate the link. Share copy the link and share or send an email.
![Google Docs Share]('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bolimsydneyson/QASR_paired_programming/master/images/docs1.png')

You can write up your code like this.

* **Screen share**
In your zoom breakout room, check the bottom bar and click the "Screen share" button. In this option, one will be sharing the coding screen.  Information about screen share is available [here](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362633-How-Do-I-Start-A-Screen-Share-Meeting-)


#### **4) Come back to the meeting room**
After 10-15 minutes (TBA), the host will send you a notification. Please wrap up, and leave the breakout room. Leave breakout room button is on your bottom right.


#### **5) Present your answer**
Host will bring everyone back to the main room, and randomly selected pair will go through their solution. _Do not worry if your answer is incomplete!_ Even if you are not done, you can explain your logic. Other teams can join and add on how they solved their problem. Also, the host will have a solution ready - so if all goes to worst, the host will share the answer.

All the answers will be shared via Github after the workshop.



## 3. After Workshop: Check this repository for answers
---
All the answers will be made available on the Github repository. Please check this repository for answers. Thanks!
