### How does paired programming workshop run?
---

**1. Sign up**
QASR will send out email about signing up for the workshop. Sign up through the google form. You will have to specify your programming language (Python, R, or both). Those who signed up will get a zoom link.

**2. Pair up & Code**
When you join the zoom link, please specify your programming language by changing your name. It will be programming language, underscore, and your name. (i.e. R_JohnDoe, Python/R_JohnDoe)

Question will be shared on this Github repository.

QASR (the host) will assign you with a pair, based on the programming language you specified. You will go to "breakout room" with your pair and start coding!

**3. Share & Explain**
After 10-15 minutes (TBA), you need to send your code file to the host. Host will bring everyone back to the main room, and randomly selected pair will go through their solution. _Do not worry if your answer is incomplete!_ Even if you are not done, you can explain your logic. Other teams can join and add on how they solved their problem. Also, the host will have a solution ready - so if all goes to worst, the host will share the answer.

All the answers will be shared via Github after the workshop.
