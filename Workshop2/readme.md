# 1. Telephone Digits to Letters

Suppose you're given a portion of a phone number. Each digit corresponds to letters (as shown below). Using your preferred programming language, write code to return all possible combinations the given number could represent.

Telephone digits, for reference:

For example:

Input: "24"

Output:

['a', 'g']

['a', 'h']

['a', 'i']

['b', 'g']

['b', 'h']

['b', 'i']

['c', 'g']

['c', 'h']

['c', 'i']



# Biased Coin Toss

If you want extra challenge, try this problem.

Suppose you want to generate a sample of heads and tails from a fair coin. However, you only have a biased coin available (meaning the probability of coming up with heads is different than 1/2).

Write a simulation in your preferred programming language that will use your biased coin to generate a sample of heads/tails as if it were coming from a fair coin. Write the simulation so that the biased probability can be adjusted.

Compare the biased coin toss with unbiased coin toss. You can compare the two coin tosses using whichever method that suits you. (You can plot, generate summary statistics etc.)
